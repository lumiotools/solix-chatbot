Solix EDMS Data Assessment (ILM Assessment) Standard Edition (SE)\n2. Solix EDMS Database Archiving Standard Edition (SE)\n3. Solix EDMS Data Masking Standard Edition (SE)\n4. Solix EDMS Data Validation Standard Edition (SE)\n\n# 1.1 Solix EDMS Data Assessment (ILM Assessment) Standard Edition (SE)\n\nSolix EDMS Database Assessment Standard Edition (SE) plays a significant role to assess the amount of archive eligible data in a given database based on business criteria and provide the snapshot of data distributed in schemas, database size and helps in identifying the Top N tables based on the table size. Solix EDMS Database Assessment Standard Edition (SE) provides the flexibility to perform object-wise and table-wise data assessment to identify the archive eligible data available in the database based on the business compliances and retention policies. There is also a provision to depict the number of rows and data size of archive eligible data in a graphical representation.\n\nSolix EDMS Data Assessment (ILM Assessment) Standard Edition (SE) uses retention management to assess the archive eligible data based on the retention policy. Once retention policy is assigned to the data assessment, the data found within the given retention period before the specified retention date will be assessed for the archive eligibility.\n\nDatabase Assessment also provides the flexibility to assess the data growth at both tables and database level based on the statistical analysis and forecast the prediction of future growth in both the tables size and database growth size in graphical representation. It also analysis data growth yearly and provides the statistics analysis of data growth through graphical representation in dashboard.\n\nThere are four types of data assessments, they are:\n\n1. Database Size Snapshot: Assess the data distributed in schemas, database size and size of Top N tables.\n2. Archive Eligibility: Object-wise and table-wise data assessment to assess the archive eligible data.\n- Table Level Archive Eligibility: Table - level data assessment to assess the archive eligible data in the tables based on the simple criteria or applying retention policies.\n- Object Level Archive Eligibility: Object - level data assessment to assess the archive eligible data by defining a set of related tables, relations, joins, complex business criteria and applying retention policies.\n\nCopyright ©2014 Solix Technologies, Inc.

Data Growth Forecast\n\nAnalysis the data growth at table level and database level that helps to forecast the future database growth. Data growth forecast is predicted based on the some statistical regression methods that help to forecast the future data growth analysis. Data growth analysis is categorized into two types, they are:\n\n# Table Level Forecast\n\nTo analysis the data growth based on selected tables and forecast the future growth of tables in size.\n\n# Database Level Forecast\n\nTo analysis the data growth of database based on top tables and forecast the future database growth. Database Level forecast is categorized into two types, they are:\n\n# Database Forecast\n\nDatabase growth forecast based on the recent assessment for default data source. Make sure that atleast once the database size snapshot must be executed to forecast the database growth.\n\n# Database Growth Analysis on Top Tables\n\nDatabase growth forecast analysis based on top N tables’ growth.\n\n# 4. Assessment Summary\n\nAssessment Summary provides the consolidated summary of all the data assessments executed on the database. It shows the graphical representation and grid tables that provide the consolidated information of database snapshot, archive eligible data, and database growth analysis. It also provides the flexibility to select the retention policy (i.e., duration) data analyzing the database growth with archived and without archived.\n\nCurrent version of Solix EDMS Database Assessment Standard Edition (SE) supports Oracle Database (9i, 10g, and 11g) and SQL Server (2005 and 2008). We recommend data assessment to be executed on recent clones of production database or production database for better output and prediction of future database growth.\n\nIn Data Growth Forecast, some statistical regression method is performed based on the current data in the database. Thereby, the database growth forecasted is an assumption so it may vary according to the business conditions.\n\n# 1.1.1 Features of Solix EDMS Data Assessment (ILM Assessment) Standard Edition (SE)\n\n- Identify the archive eligible data existing in the database (schema) based on the complex business rules.\n- Identify the archive eligible data in the top tables by applying retention policies or simple criteria.\n\nCopyright ©2014 Solix Technologies, Inc.

The nature of data changes when they pass from one tier to another. Data Validation is a process of comparing records across different databases to ensure that the data is consistent.\n\n# 1.4.1 Purpose of Solix EDMS Data Validation Standard Edition (SE)\n\nWhile extracting data from one database and loading it to another, the nature of data can change considerably. Also, some data may be lost during this transition. In such cases, the validation process helps to identify the loss or changes.\n\nThe major reason for data loss can be failures or errors that occur during loading the data. Errors can occur due to several reasons such as:\n\n- Inconsistent data in the source\n- Non-integrating data among different sources\n- Unclean/ non-profiled data\n- Technical failures like loss of connectivity, loss over network, space issue etc.\n\nAny failure that occurs due to such issues can result in potential data loss and lead to unreliable data quality.\n\nCurrent version of Solix EDMS Standard Edition (SE) supports Oracle Database (9i, 10g, and 11g), SQL Server (2005 and 2008) and Sybase ASE (15.5).

Solix EDMS Database Assessment Standard Edition (SE) provides the flexibility to perform object-wise and table-wise data assessment to identify the archive eligible data available in the database based on the business compliances and retention policies. There is also a provision to depict the number of rows and data size of archive eligible data in a graphical representation.\n\nSolix EDMS Data Assessment (ILM Assessment) Standard Edition (SE) uses retention management to assess the archive eligible data based on the retention policy. Once retention policy is assigned to the data assessment, the data found within the given retention period before the specified retention date will be assessed for the archive eligibility.\n\nDatabase Assessment also provides the flexibility to assess the data growth at both tables and database level based on the statistical analysis and forecast the prediction of future growth in both the tables size and database growth size in graphical representation. It also analysis data growth yearly and provides the statistics analysis of data growth through graphical representation in dashboard.\n\nIn Data Growth Forecast, the statistical analysis is performed based on the current data in the database. The database growth forecasted is an assumption so it may vary according to the business conditions.\n\nWe recommend data assessment to be executed on recent clones of production database or production database for better output and prediction of future database growth.\n\nThis chapter walks through the process to create Data Assessment, customizing the data assessment policies, assign the data assessment policy to the data assessment defined and execute the data assessment configured to assess the data in database based on the given criteria.\n\nCopyright ©2014 Solix Technologies, Inc.

Relationships are expressed in the data values of the primary and foreign keys. Keys are fundamental to the concept of relational databases because they enable tables in the database to be related with each other. Navigation around a relational database depends on the ability of the primary key to unambiguously identify specific rows of a table.
